"Work will fill a large part of your life. The only way to be really happy is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do"
Steve Jobs

This phrase before it was said by Steve Jobs was already something I had in mind.
Working on something that makes me happy and working with technology makes me happy.

I love learning new things, I love this roller coaster that is the IT area, in my humble opinion it is a wide universe to be explored and there is always something new to learn 🚀️🚀️

So I chose to take the Information Systems course, which I concluded in 2018.
I started the master's degree in Software Engineering in 2020. 👩‍🎓️👩‍🎓️📕️

In addition, I work as a development analyst at a company in Juiz de Fora.

I always try to learn new technologies, that's why I'm studying Rocketseat's GoStack and IGTI's UX bootcamp.

I am extremely passionate about web dev especially the frontend part.

I have experience in SQL, Angular, .Net and I am learning React by rocketseat and UX concepts by IGTI and a book User Centered Design by Travis Lowdermilk.

If you want to check out my journey in this IT universe feel free to clone, comment or contribute with my repositories and if you just want to see they are with Read.me very complete giving the overview of each one.
